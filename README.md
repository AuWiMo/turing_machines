Turing Machines
Just some Turning Machine simulations.

w_hash_w.py :
A computational turing machine that takes a startString of the format "w#" where w ∈ (a ∪ b)^*
It prints out the state of the turing machine at each individual transition in a particular process that results the final print statement being of the form 'w#w'

More turing machines may be added later, maybe not.
This one is enough for now :D
